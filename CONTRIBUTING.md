## üöÄ Getting Started

To start contributing:

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Clone** your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CRISPR-HAWK.git
   cd CRISPR-HAWK
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your changes:

## üß© Types of Contributions

You can contribute in many ways:

* Report/Fix bugs
* Suggest new features
* Suggest/Improve documentation
* Suggest/Improve tests
* Report reproducible issues


## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Setup

We recommend using a virtual environment or \[conda/mamba] for isolation.

1. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the package in editable mode with dev dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

This installs `pytest`, `black`, and any additional tools needed for testing and linting.


## üß™ Testing

Before submitting your changes, **please make sure all tests pass**:

```bash
pytest
```

To run a specific test:

```bash
pytest tests/test_utils.py::test_function_name
```

If your contribution includes new functionality, please add corresponding unit tests under the `tests/` directory.

For quick checks, you can also run:

```bash
crisprhawk --help
crisprhawk search --help
```

## üé® Style Guide

* Use **PEP 8** as a general style guide.
* Format code with `black` (installed via `[dev]` extras):

  ```bash
  black src/ tests/
  ```
* Use descriptive commit messages.
* Write docstrings for public functions and modules.


## üì• Pull Requests

When your contribution is ready:

1. Push your branch to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```

2. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** from your fork to the `main` branch of the official repo.

### Checklist before submitting:

* [ ] All tests pass (`pytest`)
* [ ] Code is formatted (`black`)
* [ ] Relevant unit tests added or updated
* [ ] Documentation updated if necessary
* [ ] PR includes a clear description of the problem and solution

We‚Äôll review your PR and provide feedback as soon as possible. Thank you for your contribution!
